# Dynamic Navbar

This JavaScript practice project is focused on generating a navagation bar dynamically in relation to the section tags in the HTML.
It was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the getBoundingClientRect() built-in function to measure when a section is visible in the window to add and remove classes on the corresponding button and section.
